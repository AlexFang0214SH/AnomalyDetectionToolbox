Description
<table class="infoTable">

<td rowspan="2">This data set is collected for evaluating your 
symbolic sequence data anomaly detection 
algorithms. Different protein families are 
constructed by different structure. If one unseen 
symbolic sequence is obviously different to the 
sequences of database, the unseen symbolic 
sequence can be considered as anomaly. The 
file, "PfamData_Normal.txt", includes 28265 
RVP(PF00077) protein sequences as normal 
database. The file "PfamData_Testing" includes 
50 normal sequences and 50 abnormal 
sequences from other protein families, viz., 
HCV(PF01543), TetR_C_7(PF14246), and 
NADH5_C(PF06455). For evaluation, the labels of 
data are listed in "PfamLabel_Testing"
