<td rowspan="3">For collective anomaly, we provides a real-world 
ECG dataset and synthetic data generator as 
benchmarks.
Premature Atrial Contraction (PAC) can be 
considered as typical collective anomaly. 
A cycle of human heart beat includes P,Q,R,S,T 
wave. Premature Atrial Contraction will make 
the waveforms of a cycle being anomaly.
