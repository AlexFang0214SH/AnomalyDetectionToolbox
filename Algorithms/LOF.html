<li>Description: This method detects outliers in data points by comparing LOF of each points. Choose a point and find it's k-nearest neighbours. The LOF of an object is based on the single parameter of
MinPts, which is the number of nearest neighbors used in defining the local neighborhood of the object. If a point is an outlier, it may get bigger LOF value.</li>
