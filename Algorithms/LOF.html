Description: This method detects outliers in data points by comparing LDOF of each points. Choose a point and find it's k-nearest neighbours. KNN distance of that point is sum of distances between it and each neighbours. KNN inner distance of that point is sum of distances between each other neighbours. Divide the KNN distance by the KNN inner distance is the LDOF of that point. If that point far away from clusters (as an outlier data), the KNN distance will be big and the KNN inner distance may be small. If a point is an outlier, it may get bigger LDOF value.
