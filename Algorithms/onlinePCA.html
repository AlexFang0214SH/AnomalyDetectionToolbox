Description:
Oversampling PCA determines the degree to which a data instance is an outlier by taking advantage of PCA's sensitivity to outliers. The target instance is oversampled and a principal component analysis is run on the data set. If there is significant perturbation in the leading eigenvector as compared to that returned by running PCA on the original data set, then the target instance is considered an outlier.
Low computation complexity and quick updating of the principal directions makes this method of particular interest for online learning.
