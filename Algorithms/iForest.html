Isolation forest is a randomized, ensemble method. An isolation tree is a binary tree which partitions the feature space randomly. 
The assumption is that points which are easier to isolate have, on average, shorter path length in the trees, and that points which are
easier to isolate, correspond to anomalies. The greater the path length of the isolation forest indexing the data set, the less anomalous the data point is.
