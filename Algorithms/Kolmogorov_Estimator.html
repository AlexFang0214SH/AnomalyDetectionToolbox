Description: Approximations of Kolmogorov complexity or entropy of biological sequences are
already well known to be useful in extracting similarity information between
such sequences in the interest, for example, of ortholog detection. As is well
known, the exact Kolmogorov complexity is not algorithmically computable. In
practice one can approximate it by computable compression methods. Assume the string length of LZ77 compression
approximates the Kolmogorov complexity of a symbolic sequence, then the
Kolmogorov complexity will increase if an anomalous symbolic sequence joins the
normal symbolic sequence family. The output score then indicates the
anomalous-ness of a unseen sequence.
