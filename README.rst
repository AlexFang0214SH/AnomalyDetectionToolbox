Anomaly Detection Toolbox
=========================

This a collection of anomaly detection algorithms. Currently they are split into three categories:

- `angle-based methods <angleBased/angle.rst>`_,
- `distance-based methods <distanceBased/distance.rst>`_, and
- `distribution-based methods <distributionBased/distribution.rst>`_.
