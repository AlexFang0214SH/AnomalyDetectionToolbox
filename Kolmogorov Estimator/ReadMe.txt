Kolmogorov complexity indicates the possible shortest length of compressed representation of language. 
Assume the string length LZ77 represents the Kolmogorov complexity of a symbolic sequence, 
the Kolmogorov complexity will be abnormal after an anomalous symbolic sequence joins the regular symbolic
sequence family. The output score then indicates the anomalous-ness of a unseen sequence.

The LZ77 defalte algorithm is from Michael Kleder, Nov 2005. The original code can download from following link:
