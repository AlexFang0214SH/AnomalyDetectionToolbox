This data set is collected for evaluating your symbolic sequence data anomaly detection algorithms. Different families are constrcuted by different structure. The file,"PfamData.txt", includes 28265 RVP(PF00077) protein sequences as normal data, and 50 sequences from other protein families as anomaly, viz., HCV(PF01543), TetR_C_7(PF14246), and NADH5_C(PF06455). For evaluation, the labels of data are listed in "PfamLabel.txt."

Those data sequences are queried from Pfam [1], if you need to cite the database, you can refer to the reference below.
